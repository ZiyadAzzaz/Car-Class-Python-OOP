# 🚗 Car Class in Python

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The program defines a `Car` class with attributes like `brand`, `model`, and `year`, and provides methods to simulate starting the engine, driving, and displaying car details.

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Create multiple car objects with different attributes  
- ✅ Start the engine of each car  
- ✅ Simulate driving behavior  
- ✅ Display car information  
- ✅ Clear and modular OOP structure for learning and extension

## 🧱 Class Structure

| Method         | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `__init__`     | Initializes a new car with brand, model, and year |
| `start_engine` | Prints that the car's engine has started          |
| `drive`        | Prints that the car is now driving                |
| `details`      | Displays full car details                         |
